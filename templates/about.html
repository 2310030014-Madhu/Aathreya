                    <h2>Born from a Vision of Equal Opportunity</h2>
                    <p>EduHope was founded with a simple yet powerful belief: every child, regardless of their economic circumstances, deserves access to quality education. What started as a small community initiative has grown into a movement that has touched thousands of lives.</p>
                    
                    <p>We understand that education is not just about reading and writing‚Äîit's about hope, dignity, and the power to transform not just individual lives, but entire communities. When we educate a child, we're investing in a future where poverty doesn't determine potential.</p>
                    
                    <p>Our approach is holistic, addressing not just the academic needs of children, but also the social, emotional, and physical barriers that prevent them from accessing education.</p>
